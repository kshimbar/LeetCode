For this problem, I want yout ro write a recursive function that will find the lowest cost path across a 2D array.
(This is like a maze problem but with no walls, just costs.)
The method takes a 2D array of integers that give the cost of each square.
It also takes x:Int and y:Int for the square it is currently on.
The destination for the path is always (0,0).
All the values in the array will be positive.
Don't worry about any optimizations. You can use the array itself to hold bread crumbs.

def lowestCost(a:Array[Array[Int]],x:Int,y:Int):Int = ???
