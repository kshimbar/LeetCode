Q1 Two Sum: Easy
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Q2 Valid Parentheses: Easy
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Q3 Reverse Integer:Easy
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed.
If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
